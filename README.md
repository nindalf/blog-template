# [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Blog template

This is a template for blogs based on [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/). End result looks like this - [site](https://next-learn-starter.now.sh), [repo](https://next-learn-starter.now.sh). I made some changes to this - I want to deploy completely static. That requires a change to next.config.js.

I forked it because I want to make some changes of my own - like creating semi-secret draft posts. I feel like that particular feature is easier to implement because it's simple JS instead of forking Hugo.

I think it's better than the template they advertise - [site](https://next-blog-starter.now.sh/), [repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).
